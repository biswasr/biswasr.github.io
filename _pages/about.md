I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Neurology](https://neurology.ucsf.edu/) at the University of California, San Francisco, working with [Dr. Reza Abbasi-Asl](https://abbasi-asl.github.io/). My research sits at the intersection of **computational neuroscience**, **causal inference**, and **AI-driven digital health** — developing principled statistical and machine learning methods that can uncover causal structure in complex biological signals and translate toward real-world clinical impact.

**Computational Neuroscience.** I develop nonparametric causal inference frameworks for high-resolution neural time series. Current projects include:
- Revealing multi-scale directed network dynamics of **chronic pain** from EEG and ECoG recordings (with [Dr. Prasad Shirvalkar](https://www.ucsf.edu/), UCSF Pain Study)
- Mapping **visual cortex circuitry reorganization** under varying arousal states in mice (calcium imaging & Neuropixels data)
- AI-based **reconstruction of visual experience from fMRI** using biologically-constrained generative video models (with [Dr. Jack Gallant](https://gallantlab.org/), UC Berkeley)

**AI Digital Health.** I co-lead the development of AI-assisted remote diagnostic tools:
- **Home-based cardiovascular diagnostics** — blood pressure assessment from wearable sensors, including a [provisional US patent](/) (with [Dr. Julio Lamprea](https://cvpc.ucsf.edu/), UCSF Cardiovascular Prevention Center)
- **Skin lesion diagnostics** — robust remote assessment from smartphone images (with [Dr. Maria Wei](https://dermatology.ucsf.edu/), UCSF Dermatology & SF VA)

Previously, I completed my **PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering** (with a secondary MS in Statistics) at the [University of Washington](https://www.ece.uw.edu/), advised by [Dr. Eli Shlizerman](https://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/), where I developed causal discovery algorithms for neural time series and mapped directional functional connectivity in Alzheimer's disease. I hold a **BS and MS in Statistics** from the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/), Kolkata.

I am on the **academic job market** for faculty positions. Feel free to reach out!
