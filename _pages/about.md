I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Neurology](https://neurology.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF, working with [Dr. Reza Abbasi-Asl](https://abbasilab.org/). My research develops principled statistical and machine learning methods to uncover causal structure in neural dynamics — with applications in systems neuroscience, clinical neurology, and AI-driven digital health.

**Computational Neuroscience.** I build nonparametric causal inference frameworks for high-resolution neural time series (EEG, ECoG, fMRI, calcium imaging, Neuropixels). Current projects include characterizing directed network dynamics of chronic pain with [Dr. Prasad Shirvalkar](https://www.shirvalkarlab.com/), mapping visual cortex circuitry reorganization under arousal in mice, and AI-based reconstruction of visual experience from fMRI with [Dr. Jack Gallant](https://gallantlab.org/) (UC Berkeley).

**AI Digital Health.** I co-lead development of AI-assisted remote diagnostic tools for home-based cardiovascular monitoring (with [Dr. Julio Lamprea](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/providers/julio-a-lamprea-montealegre), UCSF Cardiovascular Prevention Center) and skin lesion diagnostics (with [Dr. Maria Wei](https://weilab.ucsf.edu/), UCSF Dermatology & SF VA).

I completed my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering (with a secondary MS in Statistics) at the [University of Washington](https://www.ece.uw.edu/), advised by [Dr. Eli Shlizerman](https://faculty.washington.edu/shlizee/), and hold a BS and MS in Statistics from the [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/), Kolkata.

**I am on the academic job market for faculty positions.** Feel free to [reach out](mailto:rahul.biswas@ucsf.edu).
