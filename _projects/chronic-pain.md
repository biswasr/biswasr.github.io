Chronic pain is a debilitating condition affecting over 20% of adults globally, yet its neural basis remains poorly understood. A key open question is how chronic pain reorganizes the brain's functional circuitry — and whether these changes differ across its qualitative (affective) and quantitative (intensity) dimensions.

**The data.** We leverage a unique dataset from the **UCSF Chronic Pain Study** (in collaboration with [Dr. Prasad Shirvalkar](https://www.ucsf.edu/), UCSF), comprising simultaneous **EEG and ECoG** recordings from human subjects with chronic pain, enabling multi-scale analysis of neural dynamics at both scalp and cortical levels.

**Our approach.** Using nonparametric causal inference methods (CITS), we characterize:
- Multi-scale **directed network dynamics** underlying chronic pain states
- How causal network structure differs across the qualitative (affective) and quantitative (intensity) dimensions of pain
- Dynamic changes in network connectivity during pain fluctuations

**Significance.** Identifying reliable neural biomarkers of chronic pain could inform the development of closed-loop neurostimulation therapies and personalized pain management strategies. This work is conducted in close collaboration with clinicians at UCSF's Department of Neurology and Pain Center.
