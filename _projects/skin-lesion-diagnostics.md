Melanoma and other skin cancers are among the most common cancers globally, yet access to dermatology care remains highly unequal — with long wait times and geographic barriers affecting timely diagnosis. Smartphone-based AI diagnostics offer a potential path to democratizing access to expert-level skin assessment.

**The challenge.** Real-world smartphone images of skin lesions are noisy, variable in lighting, angle, and resolution, and often captured by untrained users — making robust, clinically reliable AI diagnosis significantly harder than performance on curated benchmark datasets.

**Our approach.** In collaboration with [Dr. Maria Wei](https://weilab.ucsf.edu/) (UCSF Dermatology and San Francisco VA), we are developing AI algorithms for robust home-based skin lesion diagnostics that:
- Handle the full distribution of real-world image quality and acquisition conditions
- Provide calibrated uncertainty estimates alongside diagnostic predictions
- Are evaluated prospectively against dermatologist assessments

**Context.** This work is part of a broader initiative to develop reliable, equitable AI diagnostic tools that can be deployed in primary care and direct-to-patient settings, with particular attention to underserved populations served by the SF VA.
