Arousal — mediated by neuromodulatory systems including norepinephrine and acetylcholine — profoundly shapes how sensory cortices process information. Yet the circuit-level mechanisms by which arousal modulates visual processing remain incompletely understood.

**The data.** We analyze multi-modal datasets from the mouse visual cortex comprising:
- **Calcium imaging** of identified cell types across cortical layers
- **Neuropixels** electrophysiology recordings capturing single-unit activity at millisecond resolution

**Our approach.** By applying causal inference methods to these high-dimensional recordings, we characterize:
- How functional circuitry within the visual cortex is **reorganized** under low vs. high arousal states
- The cell-type and layer specificity of arousal-driven circuit changes
- How arousal interacts with visual stimulus processing to shape population dynamics

**Context.** This project is embedded within the broader research program of the [Abbasi-Asl Lab](https://abbasilab.org/) at UCSF, which investigates interpretable machine learning approaches to understanding neural computation in sensory cortices.
